`1. Which features should be used based on the EDA results?`

![alt text](https://github.com/rizdkymaul/Telecommunication-Customers-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/asset/Korelasi.png)

Based on the correlation heatmap above, there are several features that have significant correlations with the target feature churn (according to the threshold value set at 0.15).

‚óè These features are as follows:

- contract
- tenure_range
- internetservice
- totalcharges
- tenure_monthly_charge_interaction
- monthlycharges
- paperlessbilling
- onlinesecurity
- techsupport
- dependents
- Features to Consider

- seniorcitizen & partner - although there is a small positive correlation, senior customers and those with partners are slightly more at risk of churn.
- streamingtv and streamingmovies - although the correlation is very small, it is considered due to the impact of entertainment services on churn.
Features Not Used

- paymentmethod
- onlinebackup
- deviceprotection
- multiplelines
- phoneservice
- gender
- tenure (as it has been replaced by tenure_range to avoid multicollinearity)

`2. Are there any additional supporting features?`

1. Adding a new feature for Subscription Duration in Range (tenure_range)
2. Adding an Interaction Feature between monthlycharges and tenure (tenure_monthly_charge_interaction)

**Proven by the final results, both of these features significantly support the model**
:::

`3. Conduct model training & predict churn as the target variable`

Here is the model training for predicting churn as the target variable based on business needs:

‚óè XGBoost: Although it has a lower recall value, XGBoost shows the best ability to distinguish between classes in the training data (highest Train ROC AUC). However, the lower recall value can be a problem if the main goal is to capture all customers who churn.

‚óè Random Forest: It has a good balance between ROC AUC and recall. With a high Test ROC AUC (0.860) and good recall (0.850), Random Forest is a solid choice for applications requiring effective churn detection.

‚óè Decision Tree: Although it has the highest recall (0.860), the lower ROC AUC value indicates that this model may not be as strong as the others in distinguishing between classes.

`4. Evaluate the model using Recall and ROC-AUC metrics.`

Here is the model evaluation using Recall and ROC-AUC metrics:

![alt text](https://github.com/rizdkymaul/Telecommunication-Customers-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/asset/Evaluasi%20Model.png)

‚óè Recall:
Decision Tree has the highest recall (0.860), meaning this model is most effective in capturing customers who churn. Random Forest also has a good recall (0.850), while XGBoost has the lowest recall (0.720).

‚óè ROC AUC:
XGBoost has the highest Train ROC AUC (0.940), indicating the best ability to distinguish between classes in the training data.

**Random Forest has the highest Test ROC AUC (0.860), showing good performance on the test data**


# Business Recommendations Based on Final Model Evaluation and Feature Importance of the Random Forest Model:

![alt text](https://github.com/rizdkymaul/Telecommunication-Customers-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/asset/feature%20importance.png)

**1. Focus on Contracts**

Important Feature: `contract`

-   Recommendation: Offer more flexible contract options or incentives for customers who choose long-term contracts. This can help reduce churn by providing a sense of commitment  to customers.
-   Campaign Option: **Flexible Contracts**: Offer discounts for customers who choose long-term contracts. Provide an option to exit without penalty after a certain period.

**2. Optimize Monthly Costs**

Important Feature: `monthlycharges`

-   Recommendation: Review the monthly cost structure and consider offering more competitive packages or discounts for customers at risk of churn. Price adjustments can enhance customer satisfaction and reduce churn.
-   Campaign Option: **Savings Package**: Launch a new package with more competitive pricing and additional benefits. Offer promotions for customers at risk of churn.

**3. Leverage Tenure and Total Charges**

Important Features: `Penting: tenure_range and totalcharges`

-   Recommendation: Identify customers with shorter tenures and high total charges. Offer loyalty programs or rewards to enhance retention for customers who have invested more in the service.
-   Campaign Option `Loyalty Rewards`:  A rewards program for customers who have subscribed for over a year. Provide discounts or bonus services to enhance loyalty.

**4. Improve Internet Service**

Important Feature: `internetservice`

-   Recommendation: Ensure the quality of the internet service offered meets customer expectations. Consider upgrading speeds or offering attractive additional packages for customers using internet services.
-   Campaign Option: `Free Upgrade`: Offer a free internet speed upgrade for one month to customers at risk of churn.

**5. Interaction between Tenure and Monthly Costs**

Important Feature: `tenure_monthly_charge_interaction`

-   Recommendation: Analyze the interaction between subscription duration and monthly costs to identify churn patterns. Offer price adjustments or special promotions for long-term customers who feel the monthly costs are too high.
-   Campaign Option: `Price Adjustment`: Tawarkan penyesuaian harga untuk
    pelanggan yang telah lama berlangganan tetapi merasa biaya terlalu
    tinggi.

**6. Enhance Customer Service**

Important Features: `techsupport, onlinesecurity, and paperlessbilling`

-   Recommendation: Improve customer service by providing better technical support and online security options. Educate customers about the benefits of these services to enhance satisfaction and loyalty.
-   Campaign Option: `Support Anytime`: Launch 24/7 support services with specialized training for customer service teams. Offer online education sessions on service usage.

**7. Segmentasi Pelanggan**

Important Features::
`dependents, streamingmovies, streamingtv, partner, and seniorcitizen`

-   RRecommendation: Conduct customer segmentation based on these features to tailor offerings and communications. For example, offer special packages for families, senior customers, or streaming service users.
-   Campaign Option: `Family Package`:  Offer special packages for families with streaming services and additional support. `Senior Special`:
    A special program for senior customers with discounts and tailored services.
